# Easy Desktop Test — Macros

This crate contains the proc‑macro implementation backing the user‑facing `edtest` crate.

You normally don't depend on this crate directly. Instead, add `edtest` as a dev‑dependency and use the `edtest::test` attribute macro in your tests.

See `crates/edtest/README.md` for usage and examples.
